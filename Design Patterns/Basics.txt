Design patterns are typically categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each category serves a different purpose in the design and implementation of software systems. Here is a list of common design patterns within each category:

Creational Patterns
    Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They help in making the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

    1.Abstract Factory
    Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

    2.Builder
    Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
    
    3.Factory Method
    Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
    
    4.Prototype
    Specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.
    
    5.Singleton
    Ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

Structural Patterns
    Structural patterns concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.

    1.Adapter
    Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
    
    2.Bridge
    Separates an object’s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
    
    3.Composite
    Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
    
    4.Decorator
    Adds additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
    
    5.Facade
    Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
    
    6.Flyweight
    Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
    
    7.Proxy
    Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

Behavioral Patterns
    Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They describe not just the patterns of objects or classes but also the patterns of communication between them.

    1.Chain of Responsibility
    Passes a request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.
    
    2.Command
    Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
    
    3.Interpreter
    Defines a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter to interpret the grammar.
    
    4.Iterator
    Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
    
    5.Mediator
    Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
    
    6.Memento
    Captures and externalizes an object’s internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later without violating encapsulation.
    
    7.Observer
    Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
    
    8.State
    Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
    
    9.Strategy
    Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
    
    10.Template Method
    Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
    
    11.Visitor
    Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
    
Summary
    Design patterns are essential tools for software developers. They provide proven solutions to common problems, promote code reuse, and improve system design and architecture. Understanding and applying these patterns can lead to more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software.
